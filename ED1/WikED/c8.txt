It was reductive, however, to think that everything could be solved with a simple change in government. As a Brazilian song says, “food is not the only thing we want...” The movements called “Idleness” and “Magic Balloon” called for public attention. Free to grow, Ufes chose its own path. Educating the major part of the human resources in Espírito Santo, Ufes moved South, by building the so-called Agricultural/Farming Center, in Alegre and São Jose do Calçado; and North, with the creation of the so-called University Coordination in Nova Venecia and São Mateus.

The expansion was not only geographic. The university moved beyond its walls to meet the demands of a society eager to share knowledge, ideas, projects and experiences. The last two decades of the millennium were defined by the expansion of outreach activities, mainly among excluded communities, and the establishment of partnerships with private companies. Both cases were successful. For Ufes it was something priceless: the building of its own identity.

The goal of dreamers from the 1950s became a powerful reality. Ufes established itself as a nationally recognized point of reference in higher education. Ufes has around 1,600 professors, 2,200 administrative staff, 22,000 undergraduate students, 2,000 e-learning students and 3,000 graduate students. It comprises 105 undergraduate courses, 58 master degree courses and 26 PhD courses. It is a university that, inspired by its creators, does not stop its growth. It is a place where the dreams of Brazilian people live, especially the residents of Espírito Santo.
