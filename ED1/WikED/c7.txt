A new vision was created by the university reform, the ideology of the military government, the federalization of most higher education institutions in Brazil and in Espírito Santo, and the dispersion of universities. The merger of schools and faculties in a single place was planned in 1962. Five years later, the federal government acquired a lot in the neighborhood of Goiabeiras, north of the capital city, that belonged to the Victoria Golf and Country Club, known as the Farm of the English people. The main campus now covers an area around 1.5 million square meters (1.8 million square yards).

The redemocratization of the country was mobilized, in great part, at universities, where freedom of thinking and expression developed strategies for survival. Resistance to dictatorship during the “years of steel” and during the period of return to democracy created, within Ufes, leaders who, even nowadays, are in command of public and private institutions in Espírito Santo. Student activism was realized in different stages, the first of which included marches, confrontation and arrests. Then, there was slow reorganization to establish ideological focus and activism, which had been lost during the period of repression.
