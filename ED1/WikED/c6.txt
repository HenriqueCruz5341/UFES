History
In the 1930s, higher-education programs created in Vitória by private institutions offered students from Espírito Santo the chance to study, for the first time, in their own state. Of these programs, three still exist in the Federal University of Espírito Santo (Ufes): Dentistry, Law and Physical Education. Unlike in other states, coffee trees were not able to provide Espírito Santo with the same benefits as in the neighbor states.

The governor at that time, Jones dos Santos Neves, saw higher education as an instrument of change, and thought to group the educational institutions, which were separate from one another, into one university. As a result of this process, the University of Espírito Santo was created, kept and managed by the state government on May 5, 1954.

The deputy at that time, Dirceu Cardoso, rushed to deliver administrative proceedings overnight to the Ministries in Brasília – an image of the urgency of the matter to the state of Espírito Santo. The State University, an ambitious but challenging project, was being transformed into a federal institution. It was the last administrative task of President Juscelino Kubitschek, on Janury 30, 1961. It was, for the state of Espírito Santo, one of his most important tasks.
